This project demonstrates the deployment of an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on the Solana blockchain using Metaplex. It includes the transaction details for minting the NFT and a link to view the minted NFT on the Solana Explorer. This repository serves as a practical example for developers looking to understand and implement NFT minting on the Solana network.
